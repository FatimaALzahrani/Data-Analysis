<p><em>Note</em>: Tracking plan will be as good as your metrics can make it. You might want to take a short break to refresh your KPI memory before continuing with the exercise!</p>

<h3 id="a---business-objectives-of-our-toy-store">A - Business Objectives of our Toy Store</h3>

<p>Start with the <a href="https://toystore.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">toy website demo!</a> This is a typical online store to buy teddy bears and wooden games. Take some time to discover the offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about the business goals of your e-commerce website. Did you think of any additional ones to include in your tracking plan? (optional)</p>

<h3 id="b---create-the-kpi-framework">B - Create the KPI Framework</h3>

<p>Now is your time to make your KPI memory come forward! Can you think of KPIs that correspond to the business goals of your e-commmerce?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the KPIs to your tracking plan. Make sure each business goal has enough KPIs associated to it and that all goals have at least one related KPI. Remember the main goal of KPIs is to measure the achievement of your (business) goals!</p>

<p>How can you measure where you stand in reaching your goals? What are some of the metrics associated with your KPIs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add formulas to your KPIs.</p>

<p>You should now have a tracking plan with Phase 1 and Phase 2 filled in. Check with your buddy, did you come up with the same KPIs?</p>

<h3 id="c---translate-kpis-into-events">C - Translate KPIs into Events</h3>

<p>Now that we have our list of KPIs, we need to translate them into actions (events). Now comes the tricky part of creating your tracking plan - translating your business goals into trackeable website behaviour!</p>

<p>This is not always easy as it requires you to combine your understanding of both the business and tech worlds. You might be tempted to jump in and track anything that comes to your mind, but simplicity is key and less is often more. But don‚Äôt worry, you will make it!</p>

<p>First, think of HOW you can prove your KPIs. What user actions are relevant in measuring if you are getting closer to your business goals? What does the user (or server) need to do in each of your phases (col A)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define your events in col F. Name them appropriately, using the [snake_case notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case#:~:text=Snake%20case%20(stylized%20as%20snake_case,subroutine%20names%2C%20and%20for%20filenames.).</p>

<p>Congratulations, you now finished the KPI Framework of your first tracking plan! You are ready to move to the sheet 2.</p>

<h3 id="d---translate-events-into-a-tracking-plan">D - Translate Events into a Tracking Plan</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Tracking Plan tab. Fill in the values for the events (cols B &amp; C) from your KPI Framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the right source for each event.</p>

<p>Go back to your website. Try to perform as many events from your tracking plan as you can. What are the properties associated with each event? In other words, what data will you want to have in your database about the event?</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt forget to think about the right format too. This can be especially tricky with data and time data that you might collect from your events.</p>

<p>Equally, you should consider what are the expected values of the data. This will make the future debugging easier and will also save your future self when coming some months later to do the maintenance or update of your tracking strategy. If you feel like you are the type of person that never forgets these things, you might want to put a pin on this and go check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias" target="_blank">optimism bias</a> üòâ</p>
</li>
<li>Fill in the details about the properties (col E-H)</li>
</ol>

<p>Uff, that was long! üòÆ‚Äçüí®&nbsp;But your tracking plan is finally finished and you are ready to conquer the GTM! üî•</p>
