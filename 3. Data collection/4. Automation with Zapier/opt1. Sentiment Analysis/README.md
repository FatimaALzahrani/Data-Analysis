<p>Welcome again at StartMeUp. This time, you are asked to set up an automatic email analysis system to determine whether a lead is highly interested in the product or not.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Let’s start by simulating a response from a prospect in order to have a test sample.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Send an email to your main address (use a Gmail address), putting yourself in the shoes of a potential customer who has just received a promotional email. What determines your response?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write an email in English showing great interest in the product to get better results (e.g.: I am really interested in your product, may I test it? …).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Zapier trigger for each new email you receive in your main inbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s create the Zap’s main action: classification via the <a href="https://moderationapi.com/auth/signin" target="_blank">Moderation API</a></p>

<p>👉🏽 This tool has native integration with Zapier, so you don’t normally need to call the API call.</p>

<p>Let’s pretend this integration doesn’t exist for the purposes of this challenge! 💪🏽</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a free account on the <a href="https://moderationapi.com/auth/signin" target="_blank">Moderation API</a> Tool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access your Moderation API account at this <a href="https://moderationapi.com/app/projects" target="_blank">address</a>, select the project to analyze the sentiment of a text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on “Integrate” and familiarize yourself with the documentation at this <a href="https://developers.moderationapi.com/#sentiment-analyzer" target="_blank">address</a>, where you will find information on the request, the response and an example of an API call.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take your Zap and build a “Webhook by Zapier” step to classify the content of the mail.</p>
</li>
</ol>
