<h2 id="objectives">üéØ&nbsp;Objectives</h2>

<p>Circle does B2B prospecting to sell their clothing üëö to resellers and companies. They have created a form to sign up.</p>

<p>When a prospect fills in the form, a customer record must be created in the sales team‚Äôs funnel tracking tool (Trello) to include it at the beginning of the sales funnel and allow for good communication and follow-up/monitoring. Circle does not yet have a highly available IT or data team.</p>

<h3 id="setup-1">Setup</h3>

<p>For this challenge, you will need to have accounts or sign up for the following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Zapier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gmail account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trello</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calendly</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p>What type of flow should be put in place: between which tools, what data, at what frequency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of tools can be used for this, taking into account the characteristics of the company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new Google form that collects the email address and full name. Make sure your form is not limited to a specific domain. Send an initial response with your email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new Trello dashboard with four states: Interested, Meeting Booked, Confirmed and Lost.</p>

<p>The board is called ‚ÄúLeads acquisition‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a first zap that creates a new card in the ‚ÄúInterested‚Äù list in your Trello dashboard when someone submits the form. The card name should be the prospect‚Äôs full name and email in the card description.</p>

<p>After testing all the steps in the zap, you should see a card at the top of the Interested list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sales team is happy with your automation but wants you to email the prospect to ask when they are available for a quick chat.</p>

<p>Modify your workflow by using Gmail to send a personalised email to the prospect with their full name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sales team is satisfied but wonders if it is possible to get the prospect to make an appointment in your calendar. Have a look at what <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank">Calendly</a> does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This tool looks very promising! Create a Calendly account and modify your last workflow by adding the default booking link in your email. Prospects can now be independent to apply and book an appointment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have saved the sales team a lot of time but they think you can do more.</p>

<p>When a prospect makes an appointment, their record in Trello isn‚Äôt automatically moved to the ‚ÄúMeeting Booked‚Äù list, they still have to do it by hand.</p>

<p>Do you think you can do this with your current workflow? Which trigger should you use?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new workflow with a Calendly trigger that will move an existing card to the ‚ÄúMeeting Booked‚Äù list when someone makes an appointment.<br>
To move a card to a specific list, you will need to know the ID of the card‚Ä¶ Look at all the possible actions and keep in mind that you can combine several actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congratulations on setting up this workflow! ‚ú®</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>But some problems have arisen‚Ä¶ Can you guess what you can improve?</p>
