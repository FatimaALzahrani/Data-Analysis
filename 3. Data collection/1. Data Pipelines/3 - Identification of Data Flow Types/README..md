<ul>
<li>
<p>identify the <strong>business tools</strong> involved in the data flow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify the frequency of synchronization required - <em>real time, hourly or daily</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine the types of data flows relevant to the requirement - <code>Tools ‚Üí Tools</code> or <code>Tools ‚Üí Data</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>select the different <strong>EL</strong> tools available to meet the requirement.</p>

<h3 id="a---circle-use-case-1---prospects-tracking-">A - Circle Use Case 1 - Prospects Tracking üìä</h3>

<p>Circle does B2B prospecting to sell their clothing to resellers and companies. They send emails with a B2B acquisition form to prospects (using Typeform). When a prospect fills out the form, it creates a customer record in the sales team‚Äôs funnel tracking tool (Trello). The prospect is then included at the beginning of the sales funnel and the sales team can have appropriate communication and follow-up. Circle does not yet have a highly available data team or a data platform.</p>
