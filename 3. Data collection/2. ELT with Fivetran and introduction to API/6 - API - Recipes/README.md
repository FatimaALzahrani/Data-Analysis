<p><strong>The challenge will be considered complete when you submit the URL of the document you have been working on. Make sure that the URL is in share mode and accessible by the teacher.</strong><br>
<strong>If there is no submission option on the exercise, click on the “I’m done” button.</strong></p>

<p>As you now know, when you navigate to a specific url, you make a GET API request. The response to this request will be the HTML code of the page, rendered “normal” by your browser.</p>

<p>Let’s practice with the fake website lovingly made by Le Wagon!</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The url that we will use is: <a href="https://recipes.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">https://recipes.lewagon.com/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>What is the scheme, host and path of this url?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Insomnia to create an HTTP request from this url. What status code do you get?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your web browser and go to <a href="https://recipes.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">https://recipes.lewagon.com/</a>, click on a specific recipe.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look at the url you get. What is the generic path for a recipe? What is the code after?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Insomnia and try to request a recipe page that does not exist.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the status code you get?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to the homepage and search for “chicken” in the search bar?
<ul>
<li>Has the url changed?</li>
<li>What is the scheme, host and path of this url?</li>
<li>Can you find any query parameters? → If yes, list them 📝</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Insomnia, make a GET API request on the last url that you obtained when searching for “chicken”. Put the parameters to the query tab instead of the url. What status code do you get?</p>
</li>
<li>You now have a good understanding of query parameters!
<ul>
<li>If you want to get results from the next page, which query parameter should you add?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Insomnia to do the request.</p>
</li>
<li>What happens when you query the results on page 50? Is this what you expected?</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations, you now know how to query just about any recipe! 🚀</p>
