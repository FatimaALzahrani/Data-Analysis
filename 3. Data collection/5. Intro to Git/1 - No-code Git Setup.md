<p><strong>The challenge will be considered complete when you submit the URL of the document you have been working on. Make sure that the URL is in share mode and accessible by the teacher.</strong><br>

<p>Before starting today’s challenges, make sure that you have a Github Desktop and the VS code installed on your computer. By the virtue of being connected to Kitt, you already have a Github account. If you are nonetheless struggling, go back to the Setup on the day 1.</p>
