<p>Until now, you have been practicing Git on your own in a personal project. It‚Äôs time to see the full power of collaboration that Git offers!</p>

<p><strong>For this exercise, you will work entirely with your buddy, so make sure you‚Äôre both ready for the challenge! üôÇ</strong></p>

<p><strong>SPOILER:</strong> This is still not the best way to collaborate, but we will work on best practices in the next exercise. Hold on, we are getting there! üöÄ</p>

<p>For the purpose of this exercise, you should divide the roles of Teamplayer A and Teamplayer B between you and your buddy. You both are co-workers from the same data team in your company.</p>

<p>Our sales manager wants to have two views on the company‚Äôs sales:</p>

<p>A- A view of turnover and purchase cost on a daily basis (sounds familiar, no?).</p>

<p>B- An all time view of turnover and purchase cost split by <code>category_1</code>.</p>

<p>As a good team, let‚Äôs split the work!</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>[Teamplayer A] In GitHub Desktop, create a new repository on your hard drive <code>gwz_sales_team_project</code>. No need to add a description but initialise it with a README file (it‚Äôs a good practice to have one with a description of your repo).</p>

<p><strong>Publish the repository, you can keep this code private</strong>.</p>

<details>
<summary>Where to save your code best?</summary>

<p>Remember we said it is better not to save your repo‚Äôs in your Documents folder? But where do you save this one then?</p>

<p>Well, your own repos were saved under home_folder &gt; code &gt; your_github_username.</p>

<p>This repo is from another GitHub user, so we will save it under home_folder &gt; code &gt; TeamplayerA_github_username.
This way, we store every repo in a folder named after the owner‚Äôs GitHub username. This ensures each folder is unique.</p>

<p>According to the VS Code Git Graph, which branch doesn‚Äôt exist yet on your local machine? Why?</p>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<p>The <code>develop</code> branch doesn‚Äôt exist locally because Teamplayer A created it! We only have the remote version <code>origin/develop</code>.
Note that the branch <code>main</code> has been created for you as it is the default branch.</p>

</details>
</li>
<li>
<p>[TeamPlayer B] On GitHub Desktop,&nbsp;<strong>open the list of branches, and click on</strong> <code>origin/develop</code>.&nbsp;This will create your local version of the develop branch.</p>

<p>Nice job! You both, <strong>Teamplayer A and B, should now have the same repository to work on</strong>.</p>

<p>Each of you sees the other‚Äôs <strong>remote branch</strong> <code>origin/sales_[view]</code> now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Teamplayer A] From the Github Desktop or github.com, <strong>make a new Pull request</strong>. <br>
We want to merge <code>sales_daily</code><strong>in ‚Äúdevelop‚Äù</strong>. Don‚Äôt merge it immediately! Teamplayer B will review the changes and will merge it!</p>

<p>üí° Don‚Äôt forget to change the base to <code>develop</code>, we don‚Äôt make pull requests directly on <code>master</code>. We first do it on <code>develop</code> and then we will merge <code>develop</code> into <code>master</code>.</p>

<li>
<p>[Teamplayer B] Go to the project‚Äôs repository on&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">üîó github.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;open the pull request for the&nbsp;<code>sales_daily</code> branch.

<li>
<p>[Teamplayer A &amp; B] <strong>Go to Github Desktop and Fetch origin, then go to VS Code Git Graph.</strong></p>

<p>You should see that the <code>sales_daily</code> branch has been correctly merged and that develop is now ahead of the <code>sales_category</code> branch which doesn‚Äôt yet include sql file with daily sales.</p>

<p>Teamplayer B should see the following git graph (the order in which you see the <code>sales_category</code> and <code>sales_daily</code> branches could be reversed depending on the time of the respective commits):</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>[Teamplayer B] Go to <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a> and make a new pull request.</p>

<p>You want to merge <code>sales_category</code> into <code>develop</code>. Don‚Äôt merge it immediately! Teamplayer A will review the changes and will merge it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Teamplayer A] Compare the changes and merge the pull request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Teamplayer A &amp; B] Go to Github Desktop and Fetch origin, switch to the <code>develop</code> branch, and have a look at the VS Code Git Graph. You should have the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/04-Data-Collection/05-Intro-To-Git-And-Versioning/07-Collaborate-With-Your-Buddy-No-Conflict-asset-23-Screenshot_2023-09-26_at_17.03.05.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Teamplayer A &amp; B] Finally, it‚Äôs time to <strong>cleanup our branches</strong>: you can both delete your local feature branch. Your feature is ready and has been integrated into the develop branch. So now you can safely delete the branch. For our next feature we will create a new branch.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations, you have collaborated on a team project!</strong> ü•≥</p>

<p>But we still didn‚Äôt do it quite right - what if you were both working on the same file, and Teamplayer B made changes that conflicted with Teamplayer A‚Äôs file?</p>

<p>A better way to do this would have been to merge the <code>development</code> branch into Teamplayer B‚Äôs branch before making the pull request. This time, we were fortunate to not have any conflicts.</p>

<p><strong>Let‚Äôs illustrate this point in the next exercise.</strong></p>
