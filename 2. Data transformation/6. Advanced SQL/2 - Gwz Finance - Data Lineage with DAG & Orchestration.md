<p>To obtain our financial reports, we have aggregated several data sources and performed many successive transformations. It is not easy to clearly identify how the different steps are related to each other.</p>

<p>However, having a good overview is essential for:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Orchestration - restarting the data flow to have an up-to-date analysis when new information arrives in the data sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintenance - identify where a bug is coming from, what are the associated impacts, correct it and restart the data pipeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution - identify the possibility of improving and enriching the data pipeline to meet new business needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The objective of this exercise is, through the example of financial monitoring, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>understand the importance of data lineage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create your first data lineage visualization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create your first SQL orchestration</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1---data-lineage">1 - Data Lineage</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>List the different successive data sources, tables and views needed to go from your 3 data sources (gwz_sales, gwz_product and gwz_ship) to your financial day report (gwz_finance_day).</p>

<h2 id="2---data-orchestration">2 - Data Orchestration</h2>

<p>You have understood the data lineage and the different transformations. Now we will be able to perform an orchestration.</p>

<h3 id="a---view-only-vs-viewtable">A - View only vs View+Table</h3>

<p>In challenge 2 of Joins and Testing course, we registered queries as tables.</p>

<p>During development, it is easier to use the <strong>view only</strong> method and it saves time when updating and evolving the view. This is because it is not necessary to recalculate the tables every time.</p>

<p>However, when the development of the data pipeline is complete, it is time to ask whether it is more interesting to use the view alone or the tables to save the application.</p>

<p><code>gwz_sales_margin</code><strong>&amp;</strong> <code>gwz_finance_day</code></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>How many rows are there in the source table? Run gwz_sales_margin and look at the run (execution) details tab. The company needs a daily financial report. How often should you update the data? Would you prefer to use the view_only or table method to save the output (remember the previous lesson on views and tables)?</p>

<details>
<summary>Solution üîì</summary>

<p>There are more than 1,300,000 rows in the source table gwz_sales_margin. In the execution details tab, we see that some steps of the calculation take 1 or more seconds. The queries use a lot of data.</p>

<p>In addition, the financial tracking report only needs to be updated once a day, so freshness is not essential. Therefore, it would be better to store <strong>gwz_sales_margin</strong> with the table method rather than with the view only.</p>

<p><strong>gwz_finance_day</strong> calls several views in succession. Furthermore, this will be the table used and requested by the finance team several times a day for their analysis. It therefore seems logical to store the final result in a 
<strong>table</strong> rather than in a <strong>view only</strong> to avoid recalculating each time and improve the performance of the queries to obtain the data.</p>
</details>

<p>Let‚Äôs imagine we are in the development process: run the <code>gwz_sales_margin</code><strong>&amp;</strong> <code>gwz_finance_day</code> using the view-only method.</p>

<p>Not let‚Äôs imagine we validated the code. We are now ready to change <code>gwz_sales_margin</code> and <code>gwz_finance_day</code> from view-only backup method to table saving method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the saving method for <strong>gwz_sales_margin</strong> and <strong>gwz_finance_day</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rename the 2 views with suffixe <strong>_view</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The source data tables (in <strong>blue</strong> - gwz_sales, gwz_product, gwz_ship) are updated every morning at 6:50am by the fantastic EL process you set up with <strong>Fivetran</strong>.</p>

<p>However, we have decided to use the table saving method for gwz_sales_margin and gwz_finance_day in order to reduce the computational cost and improve the performance demand. These two tables will not be updated automatically.</p>

<p>So you will have to log in every morning at 7am to recalculate the results with the new daily data so that the finance team can have the numbers ready when they start work in the morning.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre not too keen on waking up every morning to do manual updates ü§® Mmmh, guess what! We may have a solution to save your sleep!</p>

<p>The person who wakes up for you in the morning is called<strong>Scheduled Query</strong>!</p>

</details>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a scheduled query called <strong>gwz_sales_margin_update</strong> to run <strong>gwz_sales_margin_view</strong> every morning at 7am and overwrite the <strong>gwz_sales_margin</strong> table with the updated data. Use today at 7am as the start date.</p>
