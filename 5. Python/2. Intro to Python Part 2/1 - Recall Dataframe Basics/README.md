<p>💁🏽&nbsp;<u>_Note:_ </u>You may not see Google Colaboratory option from your drive as you first need to install the extension. Another solution is to go to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">https://colab.research.google.com/</a> and create a new notebook in your drive. It will add the extension for you.</p>
