<p><strong>Shapr</strong> is a networking platform to meet inspiring professionals and create new business relationships.</p>

<p>Shapr asks users to enter their company name. But this feature has limited commercial value in itself.</p>

<p>At the time the feature was developed, the company did not have its own database with detailed information on all the companies in the world. Therefore, it used APIs to retrieve as much information as possible for it.</p>

<p>Obtaining the number of employees is useful for estimating whether the user works in a start-up or a large company. To get more information about users, such as the size of their company, Shapr tried to make exact matches.</p>

<p>In this challenge, you will process the API results of all companies that contain the word ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù. The end goal is to move from a JSON format to a CSV format containing key information about the companies.</p>

<p>Python allows you to select the information you want and turn it into a CSV file that can be more easily used by other teams.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ylFGsZ1HYzs8Xa6rToQX0cafG01cA4Az/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download challenge notebook</a> and upload it to your drive.</p>

<p>Open it with Google Colab and answer questions directly in the file.</p>

<p>üíÅüèΩ&nbsp;<u>_Note:_</u> You may not see Google Colaboratory option from your drive as you first need to install the extension. Another solution is to go to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">https://colab.research.google.com/</a> and create a new notebook in your drive. It will add the extension for you.</p>
