<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P57uZh19I9W3AWvbr51iZeG05TJODurW/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download challenge notebook</a> and upload it to your drive.</p>

<p>Open it with Google Colab and answer questions directly in the file.</p>

<p>💁🏽&nbsp;<u>_Note_</u>: You may not see Google Colaboratory option from your drive as you first need to install the extension. Another solution is to go to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">https://colab.research.google.com/</a> and create a new notebook in your drive. It will add the extension for you.</p>
