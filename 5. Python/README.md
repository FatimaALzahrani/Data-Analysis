<p>This module aims to introduce you to the Python 🐍 language to automate actions, access &amp; analyze data.</p>

<p>⚠️&nbsp;This module is hard and very energy consuming. Try to absorb as much as possible but don’t get frustrated! Practice the exercises at your own pace! 💪🏽</p>

<p>👉🏽&nbsp;This module is not intended to make you an expert in Python. Python will help you to better communicate with data teams (data scientist, data engineer) but also for ad hoc analysis.</p>
