## Introduction
### Circle presentation
- Circle is a French eco-responsible and ethical sportswear brand.
- They produce technical, high-performance and comfortable clothing for Running, Yoga and Training.
- They pay particular attention to circularity, with clothes that are recyclable and made from recycled materials, 100% collected, processed and manufactured in Europe.
- They sell a share of their production to B2B clients. Therefore, they have a sales team in charge of acquiring new B2B clients and converting them for transactions.

### Need Presentation
- Circle’s CEO came to see you to ask if you could build the first C-level dashboard in Google Sheets for the company.
- She needs to present the company’s health to investors next week and she would like you to help him understand the high-level metrics reflecting this.

## I - Requirements
### A- Business Problem
- How do you react to the CEO’s request?

### B- Business Need
- You have a conversation with Elisa, the CEO, to define the problem. Here is the information.

### C- Data Sources
- Create a new GS analysis file from the template dedicated to Circle analysis.
- Import all data sources that we have about Circle:
  - Stock related information
  - Return information
  - Shipping information
  - Sales funnel information
  - Prospect information

### D- Data Modeling
- Go through all pages and try to evaluate which indicators could be interesting

### E- Deliverable
- For each of the previous ideas, design the corresponding deliverable using your knowledge of Google Sheets:
  - What graphs, charts?
  - What pivot tables?

## Turnover calculation
- The data that seems the most accurate to calculate turnover comes from the stock and sales sheets. You need to get the price model to calculate the turnover generated each month for the quantity sold

## Stock calculation
- We want to study the stock forecast accuracy in a stock_exploration sheet to know which products are most at risk of shortage.

## Quality analysis for customer satisfaction
- We have access to the list of products returned, and why they have been returned. This could be interesting for the CEO to get to know the volume of return request, the type of request and the reasons why clients return products.

## Delivery performance for customer satisfaction
- We now want to check what delivery delay is offered on average to Circle’s clients.

## Sales performance
- Finally, you want the CEO to know about prospective business and how well we can do in the future. For this, you will analyze funnel and prospect information.
