### Introduction
**Customers Success Team**
The Customer Success Team is responsible for … customer success. 🧠

The main tasks of this team are:

- The main key performance indicators for measuring engagement are:

**Project Management Phases**
For this challenge, we will be following the different phases of project management, by first doing the specification of our business problem and solution, and then doing the implementation of it:

**Specification:**
_A- Business Problem_
_Context_
💻 You are from the data team.

💬 One morning, Eva, from the customers’ success team tells you during an after-work (yes I know normally we don’t talk about work during an after-work 🍹)

“I arrived 2 months ago and it is very difficult to work properly. Our two main tasks are to monitor customer satisfaction and to proactively detect problems in order to increase retention, but we have no visibility. What can I do? How can I work?”

How would you react?

**Hint**

_B- Business Need_
You have a discussion with Eva from the Customer Success team to define the problem. Here is the information:

**Dialogue 💬**

From this dialogue, can you summarize the business need?

**Hint**

_C- Deliverable_
Determine a deliverable that would meet the business need based on your current knowledge.

_D- Data Model_
What data would be needed to implement this deliverable?

🆘 **Hint**

_E- Data Sources_
Identify in the following diagram the steps and data sources associated with the business need and the deliverable.

👉🏽 **Make a copy of this Slides deck**

You have accurately and correctly specified the 3 different needs with the priority level for the Customer Success Team.

**Need 1 - Customer Engagement - Cohort analysis - High priority**
A pivot table with the number of customers acquired per quarter cohort
A pivot table with the distribution of customers per acquisition and last order cohort
A bar chart with the number of acquired customers per cohort
A bar chart of total turnover generated by acquired customers of a specific cohort

**Need 2 - Customer Engagement - Churn analysis - Medium priority**
A pivot table with % churn broken down by acquisition cohort
A pie chart with the number of churners
A bar chart with % churn over the quarter broken down by acquisition cohort

**Need 3 - Customers - Engagement by tool (optional) - Low priority**
🎯 Try to mix results about churn and number of orders before churn with insights and conclusions you got from mailing and media use cases the day before.

**Let’s now implement it!**

**II- Implementation**

**Need 1 - Customer Engagement - Acquisition & retention - High priority**
Difficulty → Medium

_A- Extract Data Source_
Go back to your GS analysis file and duplicate the Department page template to create a Customer engagement page.

Import the customer engagement sheet in your sources

_B- Create Data Model_
We want to use the customer_engagement sheet to analyse churn and retention by acquisition cohort (acquisition quarter).

You can try to do it yourself, but it is difficult 🚨 So we will give you the different steps in the hint message.

Let’s calculate it in the customer_engagement sheet

**Clues - step by step 💁🏽**

_C- Create Deliverable - Visualisation Page_
Create a new first order cohort sheet to visualize retention by quarter of acquisition

Let’s do it!

**Clues - step by step 💁🏽**

_D- Presentation_
Summarise your main results on the Customer engagement page.

Simulate with your teammate the presentation of the deliverables

🥳 **Congrats!** ✨ You have finished all the High-priority tasks of your challenge!

⏳ Now, if you have some time remaining, you can start medium-priority tasks and finally low-priority tasks.

**Need 2 - Customer Engagement - Churn - Medium priority**
Difficulty → High

_A- Extract Data Source_
No other source is needed, we will use the one that we created for Need 1.

_B- Create Data Model_
We want to use the customer_engagement sheet to analyse churn and retention by acquisition cohort (acquisition_quarter).

You can try to do it yourself, but it is difficult 🚨 So we will give you the different steps in the hint message.

Let’s calculate these in a new churn analysis sheet

**Clues - step by step 💁🏽**

_C- Create Deliverable - Visualisation Page_
Continue your analysis on the churn analysis sheet: we now want to visualize churn and retention by acquisition_quarter

Let’s do it!

**Clues - step by step 💁🏽**

_D- Presentation_
Summarize your main results on the Customer management page.

Simulate with your team mate the presentation of the deliverables

(Optional) **Need 3 - Customers - Engagement by tools - Low priority**

_A- Extract Data Source_
You will have to combine the existing sources about:

- customer_engagement
- media - solution to EX 1 from yesterday
- mailing - solution to EX 2 from yesterday

_B- Analyze Data_
Compare engagement figures from mailing and media campaigns to churn patterns.

Are there any preferred ways to re-engage churners? What would you recommend?

How many days after the last order would you recommend to push this?

**Customers’ engagement**
🎯 We want to calculate the aggregate customer engagement per quarter for each channel.

🎯 We want to collect these statistics on the same table in a new sheet engagement_model.

Let’s do it!

**Note** - In customer_engagement sheet, we have the correct granularity - customer and quarter.
**KPI Suggestions**
In each engagement sheet, aggregate the main KPI engagement on model name and quarter
**Help** - How to group pivot table by quarter? 💁🏽
- create a new sheet model and copy paste information from subscriptions on it
- Create a new column join_key which is the concatenation of name&”_”&quarter in each engagement sheet
- perform XLOOKUP to successively aggregate engagement KPI of each tool on the sheet model

_C- Create Deliverable - Visualisation Page_
🎯 We want a sheet where the Customer Success Team can select a customer to access all its performance indicators and engagement information.

Let’s do it!

**Clues - if necessary 🆘**

_D- Presentation_
Summarise the main results, if relevant, on the Customer engagement page.

Simulate with your teammate the presentation of the deliverables

💫 Congratulations on completing the exercise! 💫
