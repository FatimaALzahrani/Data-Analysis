### The objective of this exercise is to address a recurring business need of the inventory team, which is inventory management, using Greenweez as an example company.

The inventory team has the following objectives:

- Control stock shortages
- Anticipate future sales
- Place the right orders to the production team for supplying the products

In particular, they would like to have a comprehensive overview of the current stock for each product, including shortage rate, forecasted delivery, and estimated days of remaining stock.

üéØ **In this exercise you will be able to:** üéØ

- Gain a better understanding of the inventory team‚Äôs inventory management needs and provide recommendations to the inventory team
- Improve your skills with Google Sheets
- Combine different levels of analysis (granularities) to determine the most relevant ones based on the context and requirements

### I - Import and cleaning

Open the Google Sheets (GS) analysis file you created in Google Sheets‚Äô first lecture.

**Hint**

- Add relevant data sources:
  - Add the stock tab from this raw data source
  - Add the sales from stock tab from this raw data source
  - Add the product tab from this raw data source (‚ö†Ô∏è be careful there is a sales tab in this file that is not the right one for today‚Äôs challenges)

**Hint**

- Duplicate the Department page template to create the ‚ÄúInventory page.‚Äù
- Think about the key indicators that would be relevant to the inventory team.

**Duplicate the stock sheet** and call it **explo_stock** sheet.

**a.** Add columns for  category_1, category_2 and category_3 in the explo_stock sheet and use `XLOOKUP()` function to retrieve the corresponding information from the product sheet.

**b.** Currently, we only have the product_id column available, and we would like to easily know to which category each product_id belongs so we can provide feedback to the appropriate sub-team in the inventory team. Create a new **Product Name** column. In the Product Name column, concatenate the product_id, category_2, and category_3 to match the format `[product_id] - [category_2] - [category_3]`

**Calculate the stock value**

**a.** Add the product‚Äôs pp_cat in a new column called **PRICE** using `XLOOKUP()` from the product tab.

**b.** In a new column, calculate the **STOCK VALUE**. It is the total amount in stock (STOCK * PRICE). Name the column STOCK VALUE.

**Create an IN_STOCK column.**

The stock shortage ratio is the percentage of products that are out of stock. To calculate this, we need an IN_STOCK column where each line contains a 0 if the product is out of stock and 1 if the product is in stock.

**a.** Create a filter and filter all rows with stock <= 0.

**b.** If there were any negative stock lines, what could that mean to you? What value would you put in the IN_STOCK column: 0 or 1?

**c.** Create an **IN_STOCK** column and populate it using the `IF` function.

### II - Stock shortage analysis

In a new sheet called **stock_analysis**, create a pivot table to determine the number and percentage of products in stock or out of stock

Create a pie chart from your pivot table to visualize the percentage of shortage.

**Bonus**

Improve the style of your pie chart to create an aesthetically pleasing graph with a legend.

In the product tab, we have 3 columns about the category each product belongs to.

The categories range from general to specific: for example, one product will belong to ‚Äúboisson‚Äù (‚Äúdrink‚Äù) in Category 1, ‚Äúsoda‚Äù in Category 2 and ‚Äúcola bio‚Äù (‚Äúorganic cola‚Äù) in Category 3.

Now, create a pivot table to analyze:

- The shortage rate
- The number of products in stock
- The average stock
- The stock value

By:

- Category 1
- Category 2

Create a line-bar chart to show the shortage rate (line) and average stock (bar) by category_1 with data labels displayed.

### III - Creating a stock_category file analysis

You want to create a model that allows users to choose a category and obtain a comprehensive view of the data. Your team can select any category from a dropdown list (created in cell C16) to obtain a summary of how many items are available and how many are missing. The end result should resemble the example shown below üëá

- Create a new sheet called **stock_category**
- Add a category filter and dropdown:
  - In cell B16, write **category_2**.
  - In cell C16, create your dropdown list. This will allow a user to select any item from category_2.
- **Hint!**
  - Add filter data:
    - In cell O17, write **Data filter**.
    - In cell O18, add a formula to copy and paste the headers from the explo_stock sheet.
    - Start writing a FILTER function in cell O19.
- **Hint!**
  - Add a product name:
    - In cell B18, write **Category_1**.
    - Select the value of the first row for category_1 in your filtered data.
- **Hint!**
  - Insert a model stock view:
    - In cell B20, insert a pivot table from your filtered data.
    - **Help**: Display CATEGORY_2 in the first row, category_3 in the second row, and new as columns. Use stock as the value.
    - You may have empty values due to empty rows in the selection. You can hide those rows if desired.
- Add a pie chart above the pivot table to show stock shortage based on your filtered data.
  - **Help**: Choose some other category_2 values in the dropdown to access different model information (e.g., Mode, Hygi√®ne, Entretien, ‚Ä¶).

Summarize the main information from your analysis in the Main Results section of the Inventory page.
