<p>This module aims to introduce you to the Python 🐍 language used in the context of machine learning and more specifically how we can use this to build predictions using regression, clustering and classification.</p>

<p>⚠️&nbsp;This module is hard and very energy consuming. Try to absorb as much as possible but don’t get frustrated! Practice the exercises at your own pace! 💪🏽</p>

<p>👉🏽&nbsp;This module is not intended to make you an expert in machine learning. Python and this Machine Learning knowledge will help you to better communicate with data teams (data scientist, data engineer) but also for ad hoc analysis.</p>

<p>🔥&nbsp;Being good in Python is above all about being rigorous and persistent over time!</p>

<p>The Machine Learning module has 4 blocks.</p>

<p>The first 4 blocks intend to introduce you to Machine Learning in general, as well as some specific applications using regression, classification and clustering.</p>

<h3 id="01-python-for-ai---data-preparation"><strong><code>01 Python for AI - Data Preparation</code></strong></h3>

<p>Be introduced to machine learning, the different families of models and pratice machine learning use cases.</p>

<h3 id="02-python-for-ai---regression"><strong><code>02 Python for AI - Regression</code></strong></h3>

<p>Practice prediction with regression models.</p>

<h3 id="03-python-for-ai---classification"><strong><code>03 Python for AI - Classification</code></strong></h3>

<p>Practice prediction with classification models.</p>

<h3 id="04-python-for-ai---clustering"><strong><code>04 Python for AI - Clustering</code></strong></h3>

<p>Practice prediction with clustering models.</p>

<p>During the last day, along with CSR content, there is a short quiz on the Python module. It was designed to help you assess what you have learnt so far. There is neither grade nor ranking, it’s just for you 😊</p>

<p>After this, you will be able to go through a “Reboot” where you will rehearse core notions practicing on new challenges.</p>

<p>If you don’t feel confident about the core notions, join the Reboot group! It’s an opportunity to strengthen what really matters for the rest of your career!</p>
