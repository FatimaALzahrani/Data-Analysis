<li>
<p>Directly on the chart table, add a new calculated dimension <code>IS_BELGIUM</code> (in capital letters) which determines whether a newsletter comes from Belgium or not.</p>

<p><u>_**Note**_</u><em>-  Newsletters from Belgium have</em> <code>__nlbe__</code><em>in their name</em></p>

<p><u>_**Note**_</u><em>****</em> <em>- You can use</em> <em><a href="https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/9366283?hl=en" target="_blank">CONTAINS_TEXT()</a>__function from Looker studio (LIKE does not work)</em></p>

<li>
<p>How would you add a drop-down list filter on the <code>is_belgium</code><strong>** field</strong>?**</p>

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

<p>The question refers to where you would calculate the new field : chart-level or source-level</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<p><em>You should insert a new control field. In the control field, you should create a new field and recalculate the dimension</em> <em><strong>is_belgium</strong>__once again. It would be quite repetitive and tiring to do this on every charts. We will rather caclulate the field is_belgium on the data source level.</em>

<p>üéâ Congratulations! You have added calculated fields at the data source level. üéâ</p>

<h3 id="back-to-theory-">Back to Theory üßê</h3>

<p>These are standard calculations with only a categorisation or an easy calculation without ratios. This can be useful when exploring the data or to give the company some autonomy when doing an in-depth analysis.</p>

<p>However, this should be done on an ad hoc basis and should not be systematically generalised. For these standard calculations, it is preferable to perform the transformation directly in the data warehouse (BigQuery). Using BigQuery allows :</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>better governance with visibility of the transformation in our data lineage and therefore on our dbt documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>control over the column with tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respect for the naming conventions to ensure prevent having columns with duplicate names</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reliability across different data sources if the calculation is performed several times</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an interesting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/analyticsnerd_looker-studio-data-activity-7001520757008691200-qxuJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android" target="_blank">article</a> from LinkedIn about the calculated fields on Looker studio.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="ratio-fields">Ratio Fields</h2>

<p>Go on the second page of the dashboard - <u>_Ratios_</u>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3 id="basic-example">Basic example</h3>

<p>For standard calculations, it is preferable to perform the transformation on the data warehouse. However, for a ratio calculation, it is necessary to perform it on the BI tool. Let‚Äôs look at this with the following questions.</p>

<p>In the first table, we want to calculate the average overall margin percentage for our two orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directly at the chart level (<em>because you do not have editing rights at the data source level</em>), add the <code>margin_percent</code> metric to the table with <code>avg</code> as the aggregation. Does the result in the summary row seem relevant?</p>

<details>
<summary>Screenshot</summary>

<p><em>The aggregation is the average of 50% and 10% which returns 30%. However, it does not correspond to the global margin. The global margin is 105/250=42%. The problem is that the order</em> <em><strong>421</strong>__has a turnover of 200‚Ç¨ whereas orders_id</em> <em><strong>754</strong>__has a turnover of 50‚Ç¨.  The weight of orders 421 is 4 times the one from orders 754 when calculating the margin_percent. Averaging the ratio of each column gives the same weight to each order which is wrong.</em>
<img src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/05-Dashboarding/02-Looker-Studio2/04-Calculated-Field-asset-20-Untitled.jpeg" alt=""></p>

</details>

<p>When calculating the ratio and aggregating to different dimension levels, it is not possible to average the ratio. The average does not take into account the difference in weight of the different lines. We have to create the calculation directly on the BI tool to have correct results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directly on the graph, add a calculated metric <code>margin_percent_1</code> which is the division of the <code>margin</code> by the <code>turnover</code>. Choose average as the aggregation and percentage as the data type. Does the result in the summary row seem relevant to you?</p>

<details>
<summary>Screenshot</summary>

<p><em>The calculation is exactly the same as in the previous question. Therefore, the result is wrong. In next question we will perform the relevant calculation.</em>
<img src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/05-Dashboarding/02-Looker-Studio2/04-Calculated-Field-asset-21-Untitled.png" alt=""></p>

</details>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall average <code>margin_percent</code> is the ratio of the sum of the <code>margin</code> (the total margin) to the sum of the <code>turnover</code> (the total turnover). Directly on the graph, add a calculated metric <code>margin_percent_2</code> which is the division of the sum of the margin by the sum of the turnover. Choose percentage as the data type. Does the result in the summary row seem relevant?</p>

<p><u>_Note_</u><em>- you cannot choose the aggregation function, as it is already defined in your formula.</em></p>

<details>
<summary>Screenshot</summary>

<p><em>This time the result is correct. We obtain 42%. The weight of each orders were taken into account. We made the ratio between the sum of margin and the sum of turnover.</em>
<img src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/05-Dashboarding/02-Looker-Studio2/04-Calculated-Field-asset-22-Untitled.png" alt=""></p>

</details>

<p>By setting the SUM()/SUM() in the calculated report, the result is correct regardless of the aggregation level.</p>

<p>üéâ Congratulations! This concept is essential. Creating a calculated ratio is something you will use all the time in the BI tool. üéâ</p>

<p>Not everyone understands why SUM(margin) / SUM(turnover) should be used and why the first two methods are wrong.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="mailing-kpi">Mailing KPI</h2>

<p>Calculated ratios are usually important KPIs that will be used in many charts and often in many reports. Therefore, they are defined at source level and not at chart level.</p>

<p>Now let‚Äôs put this into practice to calculate the mail KPIs. We will define the mail KPI at the data source level rather than at the graph level.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3 id="opening-rate">Opening rate</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs calculate the opening rate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the list of data sources and edit the <code>gz_mail</code> data source.</p>

<h3 id="ctr---click-through-rate">CTR - Click through Rate</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the CTR (click through rate) which is the ratio between <code>click_nb</code> and <code>opening_nb</code>. Don‚Äôt forget to set the default data type to percent.</p>

<h3 id="turnover-per-mille">Turnover per Mille</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the average turnover generated by 1000 sent mails. Don‚Äôt forget to set the default data type to ‚Ç¨.</p>

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

<p>The turnover per mille is the ratio between the sum of turnover and the sum of sent_nb, multiplied by 1000.</p>

<p>Add a bar graph to compare the average open rate and CTR of the French and Belgian newsletter. How do you analyse the results? What would you do if you were the CRM manager of Greenweez?</p>

<details>
<summary>Screenshot</summary>

<p>The opening rate is similar even if slightly better for Belgium newsletter. However the CTR is much better for French newsletter. It could be interesting to make a formation of the Belgium team by the French team to improve the content of the newsletter inn order to improve the CTR.
<u>_**Note**_</u><em>- We could perform a Chi2 test to analyse if the difference are significant or not</em> üí°üß†

</details>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a time series graph to show open rate, CTR and revenue per thousand per week (week of the ISO year). Add <code>click_rate</code> as an optional metric. How do you analyse the results?</p>

<details>
<summary>Screenshot</summary>

<p>There was a big drop in the turnover per mille the week between the 12th and 18th of July. however, the opening rate was good this week. It is due to a poor CTR and a poor conversion on the website after click. The content of the newsletter and the offer on the website were certainly not very appealing.
Then the turnover per mille increased again the next week. If we look on this period at the turnover per mille and the click rate, we can see that the click rate follow a similar curve which is logical. However, the turnover per mille increase much more in percentage during the period than the click rate which demonstrate an increase in the turnover generated after a click. The offer on the website were certainly more appealing to drive conversion and volume of turnover.
