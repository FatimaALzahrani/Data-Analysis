<p>üë•&nbsp;In this exercise, you will learn about Looker Studio as a business user.</p>

<p>ü§î&nbsp;Imagine you are a member of the Greenweez customer service team.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="greenweez-presentation">Greenweez Presentation</h3>

<p>üåê&nbsp;Greenweez is an organic e-commerce website.</p>

<p>üçè&nbsp;It sells products to B2C customers to offer them a healthier and ‚Äúgreener‚Äù lifestyle.</p>

<p>üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíº&nbsp;Customer satisfaction is essential to ensure customer loyalty and retention.</p>

<h3 id="customer-service-team">Customer Service Team</h3>

<p>The customer service team closely monitors customer satisfaction to detect any problems in the Greenweez value chain.</p>

<p>This is the heart of the company. ü§ç</p>

<p>Any change in their satisfaction must be accurately analyzed and understood.</p>

<p>In addition, the customer service team closely follows this metric as it is responsible for responding to customer requests when a problem arises.</p>

<p>Here are the main missions of the customer service team:</p>

<h3 id="business-needs">Business Needs</h3>

<p>The customer service team wants to monitor the NPS:</p>

<p><strong>1 - Overall satisfaction</strong></p>

<p>The first need is to have a global vision of the customer satisfaction with:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>NPS monitoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A customer satisfaction score for each domain (website, price, product offer, delivery, ‚Ä¶).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2 - Satisfaction of the delivery by transporter/carrier</strong></p>

<p>The second need is to have the satisfaction by carrier/transporter. The objective is to analyze the delivery customer satisfaction metric (csat_delivery) by carrier/transporter.</p>

<p><strong>3 - Filtering on customers or orders</strong></p>

<p>The last need of the customer service is the possibility to filter on a specific customer to analyze the corresponding satisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="dashboard-analysis">Dashboard Analysis</h2>

<p>The data team created a <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/50e750fb-77f2-4484-924a-fa0a8590403b/page/p_l33eefpp0c?s=jd4UMWgGlSs" target="_blank">dashboard</a> to meet all the business needs required by the customer service team.</p>

<h2 id="filtering-on-customer">Filtering on Customer</h2>

<p>Customer Service has identified a big problem with <strong>Chrono Home</strong> delivery, especially in July and August. They want to contact customers who have had a bad delivery experience with <strong>Chrono Home</strong>. As a priority, they want to contact <strong>frequent customers</strong>. They are very valuable to Greenweez and it is important not to lose them.</p>

<p>Go to the <strong>Filtering on customer</strong> page. Answer the following business question for customer service:</p>

<h3 id="identify-customers">Identify Customers</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Filtering on Customer</strong> page, filter the reviews with the Chrono Home carrier/transporter, the <strong>Frequent</strong> segment and sort the <u>_Detailed Reviews_</u> on global_note table in an ascending manner.</p>

<ul>
<li>List the 3 customer_ids that had a global_note of 4 or less for a date_date in July or August.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>_Note_ </u><em>- To sort a table on a column, click on the column_name - once to sort down and again to sort up.</em></p>

<li>
<p>Which <strong>transporter</strong> did this customer give the best NPS score?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What <strong>CSAT_delivery score</strong> did he give in June 2021?</p>

<p>Before calling the three customers who had problems, the customer service department would like to analyze more precisely the evolution of their customers‚Äô satisfaction in order to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>find out if there have been other problems with previous or subsequent orders</p>

<li>
<p>propose an appropriate discourse and solution to the customer</p>
