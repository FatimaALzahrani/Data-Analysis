<p>We will now work with the final file we have edited in section one to have some hands-on experience in using <strong>Bookmarks</strong></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h2>

<details>
<summary>What can I use Bookmarks for? </summary>

<p>As an EDITOR</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a collection of bookmarks and then step through each bookmark in a presentation to highlight a series of insights, or the story you want to tell</li>
<li>You can also use bookmarks to keep track of your own progress in creating reports (bookmarks are easy to add, delete, and rename)</li>
</ul>

<p>As a USER</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating your own customized bookmarks to see the information that is more useful for you maintaining filters, slicers selections, etc  that best help you analyse your information</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are creating a Bookmark, this will save the following items from your report view:</p>

<pre><code>- The current page

- Filters

- Slicers, including slicer type (for example, dropdown or list) and slicer state

- Visual selection state (such as cross-highlight filters)

- Sort order

- Drill location

- Visibility of an object (by using the&nbsp;**Selection**&nbsp;pane)
</code></pre>
</details>

<p>In this case we will use Bookmarks to save some ‚Äúviews‚Äù we could use during when presenting some insights found to our manager:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the Bookmark menu</p>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<ul>
<li>Click on View &gt; Bookmarks</li>
<li>Then you should see the Bookmarks in the pane on the right side of the screen

</ul>

</details>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now Create a Bookmark that shows in the filters the <code>DPD Home</code> and <code>New</code> users only and name this Bookmark <code>DPD Home_New</code></p>

<p>Hint: Bookmarks can be very useful when you need to prepare a presentation and point at different highlights you have saved through the use of <em><strong>Bookmarks</strong></em>.</p>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<p>a- Filter the desired options in the left right column</p>

<p><img src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/n8grugrnwku0pv749wjozmg85gmu" alt=""></p>

<p>b- In the Bookmarks menu, Click on ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù</p>

<p><img src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/e1y3bibdj9bhs45nokvs1ml4oc11" alt=""></p>

<p>c- Rename the Bookmark as desired</p>

</details>

<h2 id="performance-analyser">Performance Analyser</h2>

<p><strong>What is the performance analyser ?</strong></p>

<p>Performance Analyser helps you identify visuals that affect the performance of your reports and identify the reason for the impact. For that purpose it helps you inspect the duration necessary for updating or refreshing all visuals that user interactions initiate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long does the whole report takes to refresh all visuals? Is that a reasonable time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which visual takes the longest to load?</p>

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

<p>To check the times, you can ‚Äústart recording‚Äù and ‚Äúrefresh visuals‚Äù. You can also refresh an individual visual to check how long it takes.

</details>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="focus-mode--full-screen-mode">Focus Mode &amp; Full Screen Mode</h2>

<p>The full screen mode is ideal for presenting your dashboard, while focus mode pop-outs window allow to better view an specific visual.</p>

<p>To access both of them you will need to log in to Power BI Service in: <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/" target="_blank">https://app.powerbi.com/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyse your dashboard and choose two highlights that you find the most interesting or relevant on the report</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the full screen and focus mode to present your chosen highlight to your buddy. You should take around 5mins.</p>

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

<p>You can enable both modes (full screen and focus mode) by clicking in the buttons shown in the image
<img src="https://wagon-public-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/05-Dashboarding/05-Power-BI-2/02-Interactive-Visualisations-asset-4-Untitled.png" alt=""></p>
