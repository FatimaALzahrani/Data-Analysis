<h3 id="defining-analytical-objectives">Defining Analytical Objectives</h3>

<p>IMPORTANT! To begin, choose only two or three points, from the business cases. If you have more time throughout the day, you can continue covering other topics.<br>
Once you have chosen the topics to discuss, identify the main tables that you will use. Those will be the tables you will continue working with. There are different topics and tables to cover, the purpose of the challenge is not to cover them all in one day, but to be able to select which ones are the most relevant to get the job done.</p>

<ul>
<li>Define specific analytical objectives based on the business questions identified earlier.</li>
<li>Use the differents tools from PowerBi to achieve these objectives.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="checking-data-quality">Checking Data Quality</h2>

<p>Checking data quality is crucial because the reliability and accuracy of the data directly impact the outcomes of analyses, decision-making, and business operations. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to flawed insights, misguided strategies, and unreliable results, emphasizing the importance of ensuring data quality for trustworthy and impactful outcomes.</p>

<p>Take some minutes to answer this questions</p>

<ul>
<li>Are all the columns types good?</li>
<li>Nomenclature is clear?</li>
<li>There is some missing data?</li>
<li>There outliers?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h2>

<p>Cleaning the data is essential to eliminate inconsistencies, errors, and inaccuracies, ensuring that analyses and models are based on reliable information and leading to more accurate and trustworthy insights.<br>
Here is a list of tasks to keep in mind when cleaning the data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Power Query Editor.</li>
<li>Identify and handle missing values, ensuring to either fill or remove them based on the context.</li>
<li>Correct any inconsistent data entries, such as formatting errors in product names or categories.</li>
<li>Convert data types where necessary, e.g., transforming text dates to datetime format.</li>
<li>Remove duplicate records to maintain data integrity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

<p><em><strong>Objective:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the dataset by exploring the distribution of key variables and summarizing data through basic visualizations.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Identify the top 5 product categories in terms of inventory availability.
<details>
<summary>Hint </summary>
<pre><code> - Use the `inventory_items` table to count the number of items per `product_category` and sort in descending order.
- Select the top 5 categories for display.
</code></pre>
</details>
</li>
<li>Visualize sales trends over the last year by month.
<details>
<summary>Hint </summary>
<pre><code> - Use the `order_items` and `orders` tables to extract monthly sales data.
- Create a line chart in PowerBI, plotting months on the x-axis and sales volume on the y-axis.
</code></pre>
</details>
</li>
<li>Compare the average sale price by product category.
<details>
<summary>Hint </summary>
<pre><code> - Aggregate data from the `order_items` table to calculate the average `sale_price` for each `product_category`.
- Use a bar chart to represent each category on the x-axis and the average sale price on the y-axis.
</code></pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution </summary>

<pre><code> `Average Sale Price = AVERAGE('order_items'[sale_price])`
</code></pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tips </summary>

<p>Do we want to include cancelled orders in the sales trends? There‚Äôs no right answer: the key is to be aware of what you‚Äôre doing according to the objective you‚Äôve set yourself.</p>

<p><em>Would you like to calculate the sales trend for all orders? Do you want to calculate the average sale price by product category for all orders, regardless of their status? (once again, this choice depends on your objectives). A financial report is not the same as a product attractivity study. Play with filters on the appropriate charts.</em></p>

<p>Other option : you  also can use a segment to allow the user to interact with them, but don‚Äôt forget to modify the interactions for charts that shouldn‚Äôt be affected by the segment choices.</p>

<p><em>indeed, the fact that an order has been cancelled should not affect the top 5 product categories in terms of inventory availability, since we‚Äôre talking about available stock.</em></p>

</details>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="customer-behavior-analysis">Customer Behavior Analysis</h2>

<p><em><strong>Objective:</strong> Dive deeper into customer analytics by examining behavior patterns and demographics.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Segment customers based on their total spending.
<details>
<summary>Hint </summary>
<pre><code> - Sum total `sale_price` from `order_items` for each `user_id` to assess spending.
- Segment customers into groups (e.g., low, medium, high spenders).
</code></pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution </summary>
<pre><code> - `Spending Category = Sum(order_items[sales_price])`
- Add a column on users Table:

```jsx
Spending Category = 
VAR customerSpending = [Total Spending]  // Use the measure within the context of the user
RETURN
IF(customerSpending &lt; 100, "Low",
IF(customerSpending &gt;= 100 &amp;&amp; customerSpending &lt; 500, "Medium", "High"))
```
</code></pre>
</details>
</li>
<li>Analyze the geographic distribution of customers.
<details>
<summary>Hint </summary>

<pre><code> Use the `latitude` and `longitude` data from the **`users`** table to create a map visualization in PowerBI.
</code></pre>
</details>

<p>To allow PowerBi to print maps you should modify the default settings:<br>
Files &gt; Options and Settings &gt; Options &gt; Security &gt; click on Map and flied Map visuals &gt; OK &gt; refresh</p>

<h2 id="product-performance">Product Performance</h2>

<p><em><strong>Objective:</strong> Assess product performance.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the products with the highest return rates.
<details>
<summary>Hint </summary>
<pre><code> - Calculate the return rate for each product by dividing the number of returned items by the total sold items.
</code></pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution </summary>

<pre><code> ```jsx
Return Rate = DIVIDE(
COUNTROWS(FILTER('order_items', 'order_items'[status] = "Returned")),
COUNTROWS('order_items'),
0
)
```
</code></pre>
</details>
</li>
<li>Using appropriate graphs, analyze the performance of products, product categories, brands, and anything else that seems relevant to you.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="getting-all-together---1h">Getting All Together - 1H</h1>

<p>Create your own report. You will have 10 minutes at the end of the day to present your findings.</p>

<p>A good presentation should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A clear problem statement at the beginning (don‚Äôt hesitate to put yourself in a role to explain your objectives and the decisions you‚Äôve made - without going into technical details).</li>
<li>Relevant data, charts and analysis to address the problem</li>
<li>A list of recommended actions to take moving forward</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT ! Remember</strong> It‚Äôs not about how many charts or how much data you show! <br>
Your role as a Data Analyst is to interpret that data and present your findings for better decision-making.</p>
